<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A planet is a celestial body, orbiting a star, that is massive enough to be gravitationally rounded and has
<q>cleared the neighbourhood</q> around its orbit.</p>

<p><q>I think of space not as the final frontier but as the next frontier.</q></p>
<p>- Neil Degrasse Tyson</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pluto is no longer a planet but a dwarf planet. Sometimes I think, Pluto still deserves full
planet hood.<p>

<h2>Terrestrial planets</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Mercury</li>
  <li>Venus</li>
  <li>Earth</li>
  <li>Mars</li>
</ul>

<h2>Mars</h2>

<p>Mars is named after the Roman god of war, it is often described as the <q>Red Planet</q> because the iron
oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance.</p>
